                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h5>Student <span>& Traveler</span></h5>
                <p>I was born in a Siberian city named Krasnoyarsk. I went to a primary school there and then moved to
                    Moscow where my mother lived for a few years already after divorcing my father. I spent 3 years with
                    my mom and her new husband (who was ok though) and decided to go back to Krasnoyarsk since I was
                    missing the rest of my family and my hometown. After returning I stayed with my father and his new
                    wife for 1 year. After that I was sent to study abroad in Switzerland. There I changed 3 schools and
                    2 universities in 9 years. Finally, I came back to Russia in April 2019. First I was employed in
                    Krasnoyarsk, but due to some personal reasons had to move to Kirov.</p>
